/*

Recurrence relation is that relation that reoccurs or calls itself again.

T(n) = time taken to process the value of n.

for Binary Search ->>>>  T(n) = T(n/2) + c    where c = some constant
for some functions ->>>> T(n) = T(n-1) + c

if n is not defined then T(n) = 1 (always).

3 methods to find the time complexity using recurrence realtions:
    1 . Substitution Method
    2 . Master Theorum
    3 . Recurrence Tree
